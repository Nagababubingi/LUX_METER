# ESP8266 NodeMCU Lux Meter with Web UI and OTA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time lux meter** using an **ESP8266 NodeMCU** microcontroller and an LDR sensor to measure ambient light intensity. Illuminance values are computed and visualized through a **responsive web dashboard**. The system also supports **Over-The-Air (OTA)** firmware updates, making maintenance and updates easy without physical access.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time lux measurement
- Web-based dashboard UI
- OTA firmware updates
- Data logging support
- Simple and low-cost IoT implementation

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10 kΩ resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## 🔌 Circuit Connection
